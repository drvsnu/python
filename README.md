# Python
The basic concepts and features of the Python language

### Introduction
Python is a general purpose high level programming language. Created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1989 at NRI, Netherland, But officially available to the public 1991(20-Feb-1991) and was named after the BBC TV show Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus.

Example:
``` 
>>> print("Hello world!")
Hello world!
>>> a, b = 10, 20
>>> print(a + b)
30
>>> a, b, c, d, e = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
```
 C, Java are statically typed programming languages, but python is dynamically typed programming language.
 
 Example:
```
>>> a = 10
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> b = True
>>> type(b)
<class 'bool'>
```

### Features borrowed from:
